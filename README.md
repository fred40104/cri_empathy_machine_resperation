# cri_empathy_machine_resperation
----------------------------------Objective-------------------------------------


Our project, impulsed by Curt White from Child Mind, lays at the crossroads between art, science 
and technology and aims at creating the conditions for literally stepping into strangers’bodies at
a physiological level - and hypothetically generating a sense of empathy. 

Our wearable devices are capable of sensing biosignals such as heartbeats and respiration,
exchanging this data between participants over a network, and providing biofeedback which
mimic these biosignals. Through this system, each participant should be able to feel a deep
connection with one another as they experience each other's vital signs. 

The devices provide a wide breadth of usability, which ranges from psychological therapy,
scientific experiments to performing arts. They notably serve as assets in the VR experiment
"Machine to be Another' created by BeAnotherLab. This embodiement system has been designed to
address the relation between identity and empathy.
